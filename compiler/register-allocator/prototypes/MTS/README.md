## Features

1. First-In-First-Out (FIFO) static cache replacement policy.
2. Support whileloops, with less accurate approximation for liveness analysis temporarily.


## Future Work

1. Re-implement in Abstract Machine Style.
2. More efficient operations on models (bind, unbind, delete, shuffle, etc.)
3. Improve code for function calls.
